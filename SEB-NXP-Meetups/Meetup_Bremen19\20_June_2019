# SEB Productive Meeting in Bremen 19/20 June

### Payment Channel creation (Architecture)

- creating a credit based payment channel as key factor
- defining the surronding architecture in order to support the above mentioned payment channel 
- defining the amount and scheduling of sync points in order to find common grounds on the state of the individuals ledger


### Relevant TODO for me: 

- creating the payment channel based on API to create the credit
- API calls: 
  - request a credit (1)
  - request a payment channel with the aformentioned credit limit (2)
  - request the final trade in after conclusion of the payment channel (3)
  - creating an optional smart contract instance integrated into the existing payment channel construct (4)

### Problems of credit based payment channels

credit based approach is also tying up funds even though its based on a credit not a debit
-> goal has to be to remove the locking up of funds by removing the "friction" in todays banking network inffrasctructure

### Abilities of digital accounts as heritage accounts of an actual account

'Caroline': -> actual account
'Till' = 'Kiran' = 'Noah': -> digital daughter accounts of 'Caroline
'
ABilities of digital accounts:
Kiran, me and Till may only interact with each other as accounts that oriignate from carolines actual account
cannot reach any position outside of the institution carolines account is associated with

## virtual account = Permission to initiate payment (Channel)

currency will not be blockced since the funds will not leave the company the amount of time we transact within the frame of the digital daughter accounts, only after permission will it be relevant to transfer actual funds
